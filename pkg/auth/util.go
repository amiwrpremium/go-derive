// Package auth implements the two cryptographic signing flows Derive's
// API requires.
//
// # Two flows, one Signer
//
// Every authenticated Derive request involves cryptography in one of two
// places:
//
//  1. Per-request authentication of the caller. Sent as REST headers
//     (X-LyraWallet, X-LyraTimestamp, X-LyraSignature) or as a one-shot
//     `public/login` RPC over WebSocket. The signature is an EIP-191
//     personal-sign over the millisecond timestamp.
//
//  2. Per-action authorisation of order placement, cancels, transfers and
//     RFQ flows. The signature is an EIP-712 typed-data hash over an
//     `Action` struct whose `data` field is the keccak256 of an
//     ABI-encoded module-specific payload.
//
// Both flows go through the same [Signer] interface; concrete
// implementations include [LocalSigner] (owner key in process) and
// [SessionKeySigner] (session key delegating from a separate owner
// address).
//
// # Production setup
//
// Derive deployments use session keys. The owner is a smart-account on
// Derive Chain; the session key is a hot key registered on-chain as
// authorised to sign on its behalf. Use [NewSessionKeySigner] for
// production trading so the long-lived owner key never sits in the
// trading process's memory.
//
// # Test fixtures
//
// All signing test vectors live in pkg/auth/*_test.go. The tests verify
// that Derive's expected signature bytes can be reproduced from a known
// secp256k1 key — they're the canary for any future change to EIP-712
// hashing here or upstream in go-ethereum.
